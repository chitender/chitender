## 🔧 About Me

With over **12 years** of experience in Site Reliability Engineering and Cloud Architecture, I specialize in designing, scaling, and automating **multi-tenant Kubernetes infrastructures** across AWS and Azure. I’m passionate about solving **complex system-level problems** with elegant automation, driving **cost efficiency**, and enabling **high availability** at scale.

## 💡 What Drives Me

- ⚙️ **SRE Mindset**: I build for **resilience**, **observability**, and **automation-first operations**. Downtime isn’t an option.
- 🧠 **Problem Solver**: I thrive in ambiguity — turning performance bottlenecks, node misplacements, or query slowdowns into structured solutions.
- 👥 **Leadership & Mentorship**: I lead from the front, **mentoring engineers**, enabling scalable processes, and aligning infra goals with business outcomes.
- 📊 **Cost Efficiency at Scale**: From reducing node group costs in EKS to optimizing compute workloads across clusters, **FinOps is built into my DNA**.
